# Project Record

## Context

The repository was created from a complete vertical-slice brief. The 2026-08-02 delivered baseline includes the verified projectile and preview, authoritative paint, gameplay loop, cameras, HUD, exactly three mechanisms, three fixed stages, progression/save, replay, UI-independent agent interface, application shell, debug tools, Windows export, and release screenshots. The user's later remediation directive adds requirements that this baseline does not yet implement.

## Decision

- The project uses Godot 4.x, GDScript, the Compatibility renderer, Windows desktop, and a fixed 60 Hz physics tick.
- The initial runnable entry is an explicitly labeled bootstrap scene that checks project loading, 3D rendering, procedural heightfield geometry, collision generation, and the intended distant-mountain composition.
- Phase 2 replaces the configured main entry with a projectile sandbox while preserving the isolated bootstrap scene. `ProjectileData` owns tuning, `CannonBallistics` is shared by preview and launch, and `ProjectileManager` bounds and cleans up rigid bodies.
- `PaintSystem` owns one 512×512 runtime paint image and its derived texture. The terrain shader samples that texture, while incremental threshold accounting derives coverage from the same pixel writes and an inset eligible mask.
- `StageController` is the sole stage-state authority. Human buttons and cannon input call the same validated fire/restart methods; `CameraDirector` and `HUDController` only react to emitted state.
- `GimmickBase` owns common physical activation, duplicate-projectile rejection, cooldown/charges, state snapshots, and reset. Burst delegates to `PaintSystem`, Splitter delegates bounded child creation to `ProjectileManager`, and Bumper applies one directional rigid-body impulse.
- `StageCatalog` owns the exact three-stage resource list, while `GameState` and `SaveSystem` own selection/unlocks/results/settings and atomic versioned local persistence. Stage scripts contain no stage-specific rule branches.
- `ReplayRecorder` stores ordered aim inputs and gameplay events with play/pause/restart and 1×/2× controls. `GameplayAgentApi` exposes the same validated aim/fire/restart/camera actions and structured observations without HUD or mouse coupling.
- Split children are redirected toward the visible downhill face and disperse divided payload over wider lanes. This gives Split Ridge a difficult, high-value route while retaining the one-generation and eight-projectile limits.
- `AppRoot` owns navigation among separate main-menu, stage-select, settings, and active-gameplay interfaces. Gameplay emits narrow navigation signals instead of knowing the application shell.
- Presentation uses dependency-free low-poly dressing, a subtle unshaded terrain treatment, an eight-emitter paint-particle pool, bounded camera shake, and runtime-generated PCM music/SFX routed through Master/Music/SFX buses.
- `DebugOverlay` is debug-build-only and derives four mask views plus metrics/actions from runtime owners; it exports ReplayRecorder-backed JSON rather than maintaining parallel gameplay state.
- `DeliveryCaptureRunner` deterministically reproduces the seven evidence states only when explicit command-line arguments are present. `export_presets.cfg` owns the Windows Desktop release path.
- `PaintSystem` keeps paint, eligible, recent, and derived excluded masks in byte buffers; threshold crossings update coverage incrementally and each dirty batch uploads once. This removed the measured Burst-frame stall without adding a second coverage authority.
- Product behavior, technical ownership, planned work, and implemented status are stored separately to avoid treating plans as working features.

## Rationale

- A small real scene gives the next implementation phase a verified engine baseline without pretending the vertical slice already exists.
- The provided brief already locks the engine, core architecture, mechanisms, scope exclusions, performance target, and acceptance artifacts.
- Compatibility rendering and dependency-free procedural primitives keep the initial project portable on modest Windows hardware.

## Consequences

- The bootstrap and projectile sandbox remain isolated validation scenes; the StageData-selected gameplay scene is the project entry.
- The complete menu-to-stage-to-result flow, all three stages and mechanisms, persistence/replay, agent actions, debug tooling, presentation, export, performance evidence, and seven release screenshots run and have focused checks.
- Future feature completion claims must cite running-game checks and update this record.

## Current Remediation Status (2026-08-03)

- `.agents/Plan.md` is the sole active execution plan and now fixes the terrain synthesis, difficulty profiles, seed sequence, mechanism placement, direct-target solver, control behavior, Korean copy/layout, approved asset manifest, persistence migration, verification search, and fastrun command before implementation.
- External asset approval is resolved for the exact five Kenney Nature Kit GLBs, six Kenney Game Icons PNGs, four Kenney Particle Pack PNGs, and Pretendard Variable WOFF2 listed in the plan. No runtime asset has been imported at this record point.
- The current game still uses `TerrainMeshFactory`'s three fixed analytic height functions and StageData-authored mechanism coordinates. Procedural generated layout ownership, placement validation, and immutable height-grid sharing are not implemented.
- Burst, Splitter, and Bumper behaviors exist, but their current small script-built primitive visuals do not meet the new aiming-camera visibility and silhouette contract.
- `CannonController` still owns device input and the game does not yet support mouse-selected first-impact targets, explicit invalid targeting, or the damped fixed-tick target solver.
- The application still defaults to English, uses hardcoded visible strings/default typography, and does not yet ship Pretendard, real Korean/English translations, the V2 locale migration, or the reference-aligned HUD.
- Existing release screenshots and performance evidence remain valid for the legacy baseline only. None is accepted as evidence for the remediation completion gates.

## Historical Baseline Status (2026-08-02)

- Repository and agent environment: complete.
- Godot project configuration and bootstrap scene: complete.
- Phase 2 cannon and projectile sandbox: complete.
- Phase 3 authoritative paint system: complete.
- Phase 4 stage loop, cameras, and gameplay HUD: complete.
- Phase 5 Burst, Splitter, and Bumper: complete.
- Phase 6 three-stage content, progression/save, replay, and agent API: complete.
- Phase 7 application UI and presentation: complete.
- Phase 8 debugging, delivery, and final QA: complete.

## Known Risks

- Godot is not currently on PATH; local verification needs `-GodotPath` or a `GODOT_BIN` environment variable.
- The generated-terrain validator thresholds and deterministic solution search are plan requirements, not implemented evidence; generation must fail closed rather than accepting an invalid layout.
- The direct target solver must include the existing projectile linear damping. Reusing a no-damping analytic arc would make preview/impact validation diverge.
- Korean localization, asset import, reference composition, mechanism projected size, and production screenshots remain open release blockers until their unchecked remediation gates pass.
- Final targets and recorded solutions are physically validated at 4%, 27%, and 70%; wider playtesting may still reveal alternative balance preferences.
- Fresh-process replay is exact on the current Godot 4.7.1/Windows test machine, but engine or platform changes should rerun the documented tolerance probe.
- The generated Windows executable is unsigned and `builds/` is ignored; distribution signing and packaging are outside this vertical-slice scope.
- Dependency-free procedural art/audio meet the scoped presentation contract but are not a substitute for a later production content pass.

## Verification

- Observed 2026-08-02 after stage tuning: overlap remained 0.3802%; bounded flow increased a 0.015406% direct stamp to 0.043754%; one physical shot emitted 57 finite requests, accepted 8 terrain-aligned deposits, and produced 1.3274% authoritative coverage.
- Phase 4 state check: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --script res://tests/phase4_state_test.gd`
- Phase 4 render helper: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --path . --resolution 1280x720 --script res://tests/capture_gameplay_frame.gd -- --state=aiming --output=<path>`
- Observed 2026-08-02: the live shot traversed every intermediate state and returned to aim below target; duplicate fire was rejected; restart cleared paint/projectiles/refilled shots in 0.452 ms; pure clear/failure boundary checks passed; 1280×720 briefing and aiming captures showed no HUD clipping after one overlap correction.
- Phase 5 mechanism check: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --script res://tests/phase5_mechanism_test.gd`
- Observed 2026-08-02 after content tuning: physical Burst collision added 24.0171% and spent one charge; Splitter produced three generation-one children totaling 468/520 payload; Bumper redirected one retained projectile; reset, duplicate, recursion, and eight-ball guards passed.
- Phase 6 content check: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --script res://tests/phase6_content_test.gd`
- Phase 6 solution check: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --script res://tests/phase6_solution_test.gd -- --stage=<stage_id>`
- Observed 2026-08-02: the catalog loaded exactly three stages; atomic save fallback, unlock updates, two-shot replay serialization/control, and UI-independent agent actions passed. Final byte-mask physical clears reached 4.128% for First Descent, 27.306% for Burst Basin with Burst activation, and 76.796% for Split Ridge after both Bumper and Splitter activation.
- Phase 7 UI check: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --script res://tests/phase7_ui_test.gd`
- Observed 2026-08-02: menu, stage select, settings return paths, gameplay briefing, pause, clear result, and gameplay cleanup passed through the real app shell. Rendered captures at 1280×720, 1600×900, and fullscreen 1920×1080 showed no panel clipping; the bright faceted mountain, foreground cannon, trajectory, markers, buttons, and hierarchy remained legible.
- Observed 2026-08-02: the post-presentation regression batch passed Phase 2–7 checks and all three physical solutions without recurring headless errors; Phase 4 restart measured 1.080 ms under the concurrent batch.
- Phase 8 debug check: `Godot_v4.7.1-stable_win64_console.exe --headless --path . --script res://tests/phase8_debug_test.gd`
- Observed 2026-08-02: the overlay was hidden by default, exposed every specified live metric, four mask views, and ten actions in debug builds, and exported a complete stage/seed/aim/gain/mechanism/outcome JSON log.
- Phase 8 fresh-process persistence: run `phase8_persistence_test.gd` in `write`, `read`, then `cleanup` modes. Three unlocks, Split Ridge 77.921%/one star, master volume 0.43, and high quality survived the second process.
- Phase 8 fresh-process replay: run `phase8_replay_process_test.gd` in `record`, `replay`, then `cleanup` modes. The replay reproduced first impact with 0.00000 m delta and coverage with 0.00000 percentage-point delta.
- Phase 8 reliability: `phase8_reliability_test.gd` passed 30 fire/restart/out-of-bounds cycles with no projectile nodes, verified empty-payload and lifetime paths, and measured a 1.589 ms slowest restart in the final batch. The Phase 5 test separately retained the one-generation/eight-ball split limits and briefing selection intent.
- Phase 8 performance: fullscreen 1920×1080 Compatibility rendering on Intel Iris Xe loaded Burst Basin in 355.46 ms and averaged 59.84 FPS over 360 frames; the worst frame was 50.83 ms, static memory was 62.80 MiB, and active balls stayed bounded.
- Phase 8 production check: the `Windows Desktop` release preset built `builds/windows/PaintMountain.exe`, the executable started successfully, and it generated seven separately inspected 1920×1080 PNGs under `screenshots/` with no debug overlay.
- Documentation-only fallback: `git diff --check`
